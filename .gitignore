# Ignore user-uploaded media files. Your settings.py specifies the 'media' directory.
/media/

# Ignore static files that are collected by collectstatic
/staticfiles/

# Ignore local settings files. It's a good practice to have a local_settings.py
# that is not tracked by git to store sensitive information.
local_settings.py

# --- Environment Variables ---
# Ignore environment variable files (e.g., for storing SECRET_KEY, DB passwords)
.env

# --- Security Recommendation ---
# The main settings file often contains secrets. In a team, you might ignore the whole file
# and use a template instead (e.g., settings.py.example).
# For now, be extremely careful with Vehicle_Rental_System/settings.py
# Vehicle_Rental_System/settings.py
